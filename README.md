# PowerSql
## Overview

Tired of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) constantly asking you to save files? So was I! That's why I built this tool, a lightweight, no-nonsense SQL query manager that never interrupts you but always remembers every query you write.

## Features

- No Save Prompts – Write queries without being asked to save.

- Auto-Remember – Every query is automatically saved in the background.

- Effortless History – Quickly access and restore past queries.

- Minimalist Design – No distractions, just SQL.

## Installation

1- Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/yuceldaglar/PowerSql/releases/latest).

2- Copy contents into a directory.
